Package to deploy Jenkins  CI infrastructure php web-application environment
============================================================================

At last six month i deployed and configure at least twenty Jenkins instances.
All instance used by only one purpose check and test php-web-applications.
I was tired. I think better way is create package containing all dependences and external library.

So there is it. Now debian and later RPM version.
